# No Drift Event

## Overview

The **no_drift_event** is a type of port event within the DDPI system that identifies moments when a vessel exhibits no significant drift. Drift is determined by comparing the vessel's heading (its physical orientation) with its course over ground (the actual path traveled). A lack of drift often indicates that the vessel is stationary or its movement is well-aligned with its orientation. This event is particularly useful for detecting vessels at anchor within a port area.
