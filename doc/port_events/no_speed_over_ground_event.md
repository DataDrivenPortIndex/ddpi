# No Speed Over Ground Event

## Overview

The **no_speed_over_ground_event** is a specific port-related event within the DDPI system that is triggered when no `Speed Over Ground (SOG)` value exceeding a defined threshold is detected for a vessel over a specified period. This event is indicative of stationary behavior, such as anchoring, mooring, or waiting at a port, and serves as a critical input for understanding vessel activities and validating port operations.
