# No Rate Of Turn Event

## Overview

The **no_rate_of_turn_changed_event** is a port-related event within the DDPI system that is triggered when no significant changes in the `Rate of Turn (ROT)` field of AIS data are detected over a defined period. This event indicates stationary behavior, such as anchoring, mooring, or waiting in the port area. It provides valuable insights into vessel activities and supports the analysis of port operations and maritime traffic.
